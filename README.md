# mptf-daily-key-prices
Runs a daily script to extract the current sale price of keys on Marketplace.tf and makes the price data available as a JSON file via GitHub pages.

This script was first ran on 5/12/2025. All key price data from before this date was aggregated from price data saved by other TF2 developers or from sales data from large-scale key sellers.
